## UX

### User Stories

#### Project Goals

The primary goal of Freestyle Fanatics is to provide a hub of all things freestyle to all aged 12 - adult with easy and clear navigation with signposting to external sites where necessary. 

#### Dancer Goals

The main target audeince for this website is dancers aged 12 and over.

Dancers and guardian goals are:

  * Navigate way around site easily.
  * Easily follow links to signposted pages.
  * Find the site informative, fun and engaging.
  * Know what the next steps to take are to learn to dance or compete and who is qualified to teach me.
  * Easily navigate to the facebook page to follow and interact.
  * Be able to contact the site owner.
  * To be informed of and able to locate regulatory associations. 
  * Be able to see a photo and video examples of freestyle dancing.

Freestyle Fanatics can help dancers meet these goals by:

  * Providing relevant information and links all in one website.
  * Providing a simple and clear navigation bar.
  * Give dancers information about freestyle dance and relevant associated information.
  * Engaging images and video to allow dancer to know they have found the site for the 
    correct genre.
  * Same theme and layout for all pages.
  * Use a maximum of 3 clicks from start to end goal to minimise cognitive 
    overload.
  * The feel is engaging and informative.
  * Using a Favicon on all pages.

### Design Choices

  * Single column mobile first responsive design.

#### Colour Scheme

  * Four colours will be used in addition to black and white throughout the site to create a theme. The colour pallette was picked from the hero image on the home page. This should carry the site identity across all pages.

![A young girl performing a dance routine on stage, dressed in a sparkling blue costume with feathered accessories, surrounded by an attentive audience.](docs/design/color_palette.png)

#### Typography

  * The Poppins font will be the font used for the all headings on the website and Sans Serif is to be used as a fallback font should for any reason the Poppins google font not load correctly to the website. Poppins is a crisp clear font that has rounded features that adds flow and creativity whilst having a corporate edge.

  * The Roboto font will be the font used for the other text on the website and Sans Serif is to be used as a fallback font should for any reason the Roboto google font not load correctly to the website. Roboto is a sharper font that has less rounded features than Poppins having more of a corporate edge, complimenting the poppins font with increased ease of readability for smaller text.

#### Imagery

  * Imagery is key to immediately letting the user know they are viewing the correct dance genre and engage quickly and convey a positive and energetic vibe.
  * The initial imagery will be the hero sections on the index.html and competition.html pages.

  ![mobile device showing website on screen](docs/design/screenshots/navbar.png)

  * A image carousel will be located on the homepage to engage and inform the user.
  * There will be a favicon in the browser bar on all pages helping with site identity and branding.

  ![desktop browser bar](docs/design/screenshots/favicon_browser.png)

    in mobile view. The mobile home wireframe is shown below.

## Testing

### Overall Peformance

The complete site was tested on the lighthouse facility in Google Developer Tools to assess the overall performance of the site. The site meets the pass criteria and you can see the results in the below table.

| Page     | Screenshot                                                         | Notes                                        |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
|Home      |![screenshot](docs/testing/lighthouse/lighthouse_home.png)          |Some warnings for performance.                |
|Competing |![screenshot](docs/testing/lighthouse/lighthouse_competitions.png)  |Accessibility 100%. Performance could improve.|
|Contact   |![screenshot](docs/testing/lighthouse/lighthouse_contact.png)       |Good overall.                                 |
|Submission|![screenshot](docs/testing/lighthouse/lighthouse_submission.png)    |Very good overall.                            |
|404       |![screenshot](docs/testing/lighthouse/lighthouse_404.png)           |Good overall.                                 |          



### Code Validation

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.
The results and screenshots are in the table below.

| Page     | Screenshot                                                           | Notes  |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
|Home      |![screenshot](docs/testing/code_validation/validation_home.png)       | Passed |
|Competing |![screenshot](docs/testing/code_validation/validation_competition.png)| Passed |
|Contact   |![screenshot](docs/testing/code_validation/validation_contact.png)    | Passed |
|Submission|![screenshot](docs/testing/code_validation/validation_submission.png) | Passed |
|404       |![screenshot](docs/testing/code_validation/validation_404.png)        | Passed | 
|CSS       |![screenshot](docs/testing/code_validation/validation_css.png)        | Passed |


### Accessibility Testing

  * The complete site was tested using [Web Aim](https://wave.webaim.org/) and has passed. This can be [viewed here](docs/testing/webaim.png).
  * Some issues were created using the jumbotron to create a hero section. For some reason the only way i could 
    create the hero image with the jumbotron in front was to use a background images in the jumbotron div css. Whilst this is not best practice for accessibility it has not impacted the score for accessibility which is 100%. If i were using the image in the HTML i would add an alt tag to the image to make it accessible. 
  * Testing on all pages also carried out on lighthouse developer tools see above table.

### Bug Fixes

  * Bug found where the bootstrap navigation bar would expand but not compress back down. The issue was eventually traced back to  
    the js script links at the bottom of the html pages. These have been updated and it now works as it should. The issue can be viewed on [this screenshot](docs/bug_fixes/navbar_bugfix.png) for further details.
  * There is a bug on the submit button on the contact form in contact.html. There is an active class that when 
    the button is clicked it changes colour even if all the required fields are not filled out and the form 'sent'. I have logged this issue with bootstrap as it appears it cant be overridden and is an error at bootstrap. It does not seem to effect the submission of the form itself and is more of an aesthetic and design issue to be rectified.

### Hero Image Change

A change in hero image on the homepage was made with the same colour theme as i feel the updated image is more fun and engaging than the original meeting the user story and UX design criteria.
